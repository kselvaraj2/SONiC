## 1. Overview
Rapid network availability is essential, and SONiC's boot time directly impacts this. To improve startup speed, this project focuses on optimizing service initialization by replacing the existing process supervisor with a higher-performance alternative. This is particularly crucial for switches leveraging the ASIC's internal CPU to run SONiC.

## 2. Requirements
* Minimize SONiC boot time.
* Maintain compatibility with existing SONiC services and configurations.
* Ensure the stability and reliability of the new supervisor.
* Implement a seamless transition with minimal disruption.

## 3. Architecture Design
To enhance performance, the current process supervisor inside docker will be replaced with runit. Existing service configurations will be converted to the runit format, and the system's init process will be modified to use runit.

## 4. High-Level Design

### 4.1 Boot time measurement using supervisor method
Boot time analysis on a 48-port device with a dual-core ARM-v8.2 Cortex-A55 CPU cluster revealed the following breakdown:


```
| Operation                     | Total Time (mm:ss) | Time Delta (mm:ss) |
|-------------------------------|------------------- |--------------------|
| Reboot to BIOS Print          | 02:09              |                    |
| BIOS Print to SONiC Login     | 02:45              | 00:36              |
| SONiC System Up Time          | 07:45              | 05:00              |
| Show Interface with Link Up   | 11:45              | 04:00              |
```
Initialization performance analysis revealed that supervisord and supervisorctl contribute significantly to boot time, consuming roughly 20% of the total initialization period. This suggests that migrating away from these Python-based tools might offer a performance improvement. Generally, Python applications can exhibit slower startup times in these types of scenarios.

Potential replacement supervisors will be evaluated based on criteria such as speed, resource consumption, and ease of integration with SONiC:
* **runit:**  Simple, robust, and performant.
* **tini:** Minimalistic, ideal for containerized environments, if applicable to SONiC's services.



### 4.2 Comparison between Different supervisors

```
| Feature                       | Supervisord                             | Runit                               |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Language                      | Python                                  | C                                   |
| Goal                          | Feature-rich process management   	  | Simple & robust service supervision |
| Resource                      | Low overhead                            | High overhead                       |
| Boot time                     | Fast                                    | Slow                                |
| Configuration                 | Directory based                         | File based                          |
| Process Control               | Service Monitoring                      | Extensive process control           |

```

Tini is not explored since it doesnt have monitoring capability.

### 4.3 Boot time improvement using runit method

Replacing supervisord with runit on a 48-port device featuring a dual-core ARM-v8.2 Cortex-A55 CPU cluster yielded a 15-20% improvement in overall boot time and interface link-up time. Baseline measurements were:



```
|                               | Runit                                   | Supervisord                             |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Operation                     | Total Time (mm:ss) | Time Delta (mm:ss) | Total Time (mm:ss) | Time Delta (mm:ss) |
|-------------------------------|------------------- |--------------------|------------------- |--------------------|
| Reboot to BIOS Print          | 01:55              |                    | 02:09              |                    |
| BIOS Print to SONiC Login     | 02:26              | 00:31              | 02:45              | 00:36              |
| SONiC System Up Time          | 06:45              | 04:20              | 07:45              | 05:00              |
| Show Interface with Link Up   | 09:45              | 03:00              | 11:45              | 04:00              |
```

### 4.4 Service Transition

A Python script automates the conversion of existing Supervisor (specifically supervisord) configurations into the runit format. This script, executed as part of a Docker entrypoint, transforms the provided supervisord configuration into runit service directories. This approach facilitates migration for Docker applications utilizing Jinja2 templated configuration files alongside traditional supervisord.conf files.

```
A Supervisor configuration defines a program named orchagent. This program, /usr/bin/orchagent.sh, depends on the portsyncd service. The conversion script translates this dependency into a runit run script for the orchagent service. The generated /etc/service/orchagent/run script waits for portsyncd to reach a running state before executing /usr/bin/orchagent.sh. This ensures the dependency is met before the orchagent process starts.

Example 1:

[program:orchagent]                         
command=/usr/bin/orchagent.sh               
priority=4                                  
autostart=false                             
autorestart=false                           
stdout_capture_maxbytes=1MB                 
stdout_logfile=syslog                       
stderr_logfile=syslog                       
dependent_startup=true                      
dependent_startup_wait_for=portsyncd:running

This will be converted as follows in the transition script
cat /etc/service/orchagent/run
#!/bin/sh  
while ! sv status portsyncd | grep -q 'run:'; do
    sleep 1
done

exec /usr/bin/orchagent.sh

Example 2:

neighsyncd has to be started only after swssconfig is exited is handled as follows.

[program:neighsyncd]                         
command=/usr/bin/neighsyncd                  
priority=7                                   
autostart=false                              
autorestart=false                            
stdout_logfile=syslog                        
stderr_logfile=syslog                        
dependent_startup=true                       
dependent_startup_wait_for=swssconfig:exited 

root@Celestica-ES1000-24P:/# cat /etc/service/neighsyncd/run   
#!/bin/sh                                                      
                                                               
while ! sv status swssconfig | grep -q 'down:'; do             
    sleep 1                                                    
done                                                           
                                                               
exec /usr/bin/neighsyncd                                       
```


### 4.5 Enabling Runit as supervisor

To enable runit as the process supervisor, create an empty file named /etc/runit-manager and then trigger a configuration reload. This can be achieved by executing the command config reload or by reloading the device.

```
touch /etc/runit-manager
config reload [or] reload the device
```

This process triggers the following:

1. When the service is restarted using systemctl, the existing Docker service is removed.
2. A new Docker service is created with the Docker label sonic_docker_config="runit" and the Docker environment variable sonic_docker_config="runit".
3. When Docker starts, it verifies the above environment variable and chooses whether to execute the Docker process with runit or supervisord as the supervisor.

### 4.6 Managing Critical Processes with runit
SONiC includes a feature to restart the Docker container if a critical process exits due to system signals (such as SIGTERM, SIGSEGV, etc.). This is managed by /usr/bin/supervisor-proc-exit-listener running inside the container.

This functionality is achieved using a runit finish script for critical processes, which terminates the Docker container by sending a signal to process ID 1, as shown below:

```
root@Celestica-ES1000-24P:/# cat /etc/service/orchagent/finish
#!/bin/sh                                                     
sv stop orchagent                                             
exec kill -s SIGTERM 1                                        
exit 0                     
```

### 4.7 System Health Monitoring
SONiC continuously monitors Docker health status using a system-health checker script. This script executes supervisorctl status inside the Docker container to fetch the running status of each process, as shown below:

```
show system-health detail
swss:orchagent             OK        Process
swss:portsyncd             OK        Process
swss:neighsyncd            OK        Process
swss:fdbsyncd              OK        Process
...
```

To achieve this functionality, the system-health checker has been enhanced to handle both supervisorctl and runit. It uses separate classes depending on the system configuration, validated by checking the Docker container label "sonic_docker_config"

service status can be fetched using following commands

```
sv status /etc/service/*
run: /etc/service/buffermgrd: (pid 84) 2394s
run: /etc/service/orchagent: (pid 99) 2394s
```


### 4.8 Disabling runit and Re-enabling Supervisor
Removing /etc/runit-manager and then rebooting (or executing config reload) will restore Supervisor as the process manager. The system will then launch containers configured to use supervisord, effectively reversing the migration to runit.


```
rm /etc/runit-manager
reboot [or] config reload
```

1. For low end CPU systems python performance is impacting the overall system readiness need to optimize the following without using python
   a) Implementing pmon docker in pypy3 is a start (since all pmon process are dependent on C/C++ library libswsscommon.so) pypy3 does not support C-API integration , need to explore further
   b) Independent scripts like 
      /usr/local/bin/procdockerstatsd
      /usr/bin/monit - C or Rust based implementation will help
